# Create Task Project

## Runtime
[Link to runtime](https://nastyawakened.cf/quizcrud/quizDB/)

## Idea
* Create a system of taking a quiz where you can see if you are correct or incorrect, move to next question, and get a score.
* Also have a database so that quiz questions can be created and stored server side. 
* [Issue with commits](https://github.com/NastyAwakened/NastyAwakened/issues/136)
* [Jump to my video and written responses](https://github.com/AD1616/ADtri3python/blob/main/createtask.md#my-video)
* PBL Feature: This is implemented as PBL and can be found under the "Classes tab" and is called "Quiz Page".

## Snippets
## How my project meets the program requirements
* Input from user on which answer is selected, also next question and submit button

Code for one of the answer choice inputs: 
```html
<div id='block-11' style='padding: 10px;'>
            <label for='option1' style=' padding: 5px; font-size: 2.5rem;'>
                <input type='radio' name='option' value='' id='option1' style='transform: scale(1.6); margin-right: 10px; vertical-align: middle; margin-top: -2px;' />
                <span id='choicetext-1'></span>
                <div class="incorrect"></div>
            </label>
            <span id='result-11'></span>
        </div>
```
Code for choosing which question to see at end input box:
```html
<div id="show" style="display: none">
        <input type="text" id="chosenQuestion">
        <button id="chosenButton" onclick="specificQuestion()"> Choose which question to see</button>
    </div>
```
Code for button to go to next question, calling newQuestion function:
```html
 <button id = "newQuestionButton", onclick="newQuestion()">New Question</button>
```

* List of dictionaries stores data of the quiz questions and answers

Code:
```python 
@app_crud_quiz.route('/quizDB/')
def quizDB():
    """obtains all Users from table and loads Admin Form"""
    # table = quiz_all passes in the entire data table
    questionDict = [
        {'questionID': 1, 'question': 'Which of these is in OOP?', 'answer1': 'Class', 'answer2': 'Blueprint', 'answer3': 'IP Address', 'answer4': 'GET', 'correctAnswer': 'Class'},
        {'questionID': 2, 'question': 'Which of these is a binary number?', 'answer1': '0101', 'answer2': '#FFFFFF', 'answer3': '49', 'answer4': '2', 'correctAnswer': '0101'},
        {'questionID': 3, 'question': 'Which of these is NOT an HTTP verb for requests?', 'answer1': 'GET', 'answer2': 'POST', 'answer3': 'DELETE', 'answer4': 'GIVE', 'correctAnswer': 'GIVE'},
    ]
    return render_template("quizDB.html", table=questionDict)
```


* Procedure for displayQuestion has parameter of chosen question so it knows which question to display. The return type is just string in changing the DOM.

Code:
```javascript 
 {# Function with parameters, showing a specific question. Called in newQuestion. #}
        function displayQuestion(chosenQuestion) {
            document.getElementById('showQuestion').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['question'];
            document.getElementById('choicetext-1').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer1'];
            document.getElementById('choicetext-2').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer2'];
            document.getElementById('choicetext-3').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer3'];
            document.getElementById('choicetext-4').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer4'];
        }
```
* Sequence through if/else statement with question number
* Selection by displaying the specific questions based on the index (which is determined by question number)

Code for both sequence and selection: 
```javascript 
           if ((questionNumber+1 >= allData.length)) {
                document.getElementById('newQuestionButton').innerHTML = 'End Quiz'
                end+=1
                console.log(end)
                if (end==2) {
                    document.getElementById('done').innerHTML = 'Good job! You got ' + score + '/' + (allData.length).toString()
                    {# Calling the function to show the input box to look at a specific question #}
                    show_last();
                }
            }
            else {
                document.getElementById('newQuestionButton').innerHTML = 'Next Question';
                questionNumber +=1
            }
```
* Iteration in the answer checking system

Code:
```javascript 
for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
                if (document.getElementById('option' + i).checked) {
                    if (correct ==  allData[answerindex]['answer' + i.toString()]) {
                        var x = allData[answerindex]['answer' + i.toString()];
                        console.log(x)
                        document.getElementById('block-1' + i.toString()).style.border = '3px solid limegreen'
                        document.getElementById('result-1' + i.toString()).style.color = 'limegreen'
                        document.getElementById('result-1' + i.toString()).innerHTML = 'Correct!'
                        score = score + 1
                    }
                    else {
                        document.getElementById('block-1' + i.toString()).style.border = '3px solid red'
                        document.getElementById('result-1' + i.toString()).style.color = 'red'
                        document.getElementById('result-1' + i.toString()).innerHTML = 'Incorrect!'
                    }
                }
            }
```
* Procedure is called by the button

Code:
```html 
<button id = "newQuestionButton", onclick="newQuestion()">New Question</button>
```
```javascript
 if (end==2) {
                    document.getElementById('done').innerHTML = 'Good job! You got ' + score + '/' + (allData.length).toString()
                    {# Calling the function to show the input box to look at a specific question #}
                    show_last();
                }
```
* Instructions for output through comments in the code.

# My Video

* [Sahil Create Task Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9sHHwXYmSk)

# Written Responses

* 3a-3d responses should not be more than 750 words, not including code.

## 3a. Provide a written response that does all three of the following:

### Describes the overall purpose of the program

* The purpose of the program is for a user to be able to make questions and answers and store them on a database; right now it is just a list in a python file. Then, they can be presented in a quiz format that gives insight into correct answers and also provides a score. 

### Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video

* The functionality of the program shown is to be able to take a quiz and get a score, as well as a final result. Each time you answer a question, the program will tell you if you are correct or wrong. Previous questions can be viewed again upon finishing the quiz.

### Describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video

* Input of the program is shown through being able to select an answer choice as well as pressing the buttons for next question and submit. Output is shown through correct/incorrect upon answering as well as a score and the display of the question and answer choices. Input is also there for the text box to show score, output is to show or hide score. Finally, input is there for textbox to show questions and answers and output is the display through changing the DOM(Document Object Model). 

## 3b. Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program.

###  The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list. 

```python 
@app_crud_quiz.route('/quizDB/')
def quizDB():
    """obtains all Users from table and loads Admin Form"""
    # table = quiz_all passes in the entire data table
    questionDict = [
        {'questionID': 1, 'question': 'Which of these is in OOP?', 'answer1': 'Class', 'answer2': 'Blueprint', 'answer3': 'IP Address', 'answer4': 'GET', 'correctAnswer': 'Class'},
        {'questionID': 2, 'question': 'Which of these is a binary number?', 'answer1': '0101', 'answer2': '#FFFFFF', 'answer3': '49', 'answer4': '2', 'correctAnswer': '0101'},
        {'questionID': 3, 'question': 'Which of these is NOT an HTTP verb for requests?', 'answer1': 'GET', 'answer2': 'POST', 'answer3': 'DELETE', 'answer4': 'GIVE', 'correctAnswer': 'GIVE'},
    ]
    return render_template("quizDB.html", table=questionDict)
```


### The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the programâ€™s purpose. 

```javascript
  {# Passing question data from python to jinja #}
  {% set allData = table %}

  {# Passing in the data table from jinja to javascript; now it can be used easily in javascript#}
        var allData = {{ allData | safe}};
   {# Function with parameters, showing a specific question. Called in newQuestion. #}
        function displayQuestion(chosenQuestion) {
            if (chosenQuestion-1 > -1 && chosenQuestion < allData.length) {
                document.getElementById("all").style.display = 'inline';
                document.getElementById('showQuestion').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['question'];
                document.getElementById('choice1').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer1'];
                document.getElementById('choice2').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer2'];
                document.getElementById('choice3').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer3'];
                document.getElementById('choice4').innerHTML = allData[chosenQuestion-1]['answer4'];
            }
            else {
                var displayed = Math.floor(Math.random() * (allData.length))
                document.getElementById("all").style.display = 'inline';
                document.getElementById('showQuestion').innerHTML = allData[displayed]['question'];
                document.getElementById('choice1').innerHTML = allData[displayed]['answer1'];
                document.getElementById('choice2').innerHTML = allData[displayed]['answer2'];
                document.getElementById('choice3').innerHTML = allData[displayed]['answer3'];
                document.getElementById('choice4').innerHTML = allData[displayed]['answer4'];
            }
        }
 {# This function is called by the button for begin quiz/next question/endquiz; it determines what questions and answers to display based on the value of question number. #}
        {# Question number is also updated through this procedure #}
        function newQuestion() {
            if (questionNumber > -1) {
                document.getElementById("all").style.display = 'inline';
            }
            document.getElementById('showQuestion').innerHTML = allData[questionNumber]['question'];
            document.getElementById('choice1').innerHTML = allData[questionNumber]['answer1'];
            document.getElementById('choice2').innerHTML = allData[questionNumber]['answer2'];
            document.getElementById('choice3').innerHTML = allData[questionNumber]['answer3'];
            document.getElementById('choice4').innerHTML = allData[questionNumber]['answer4'];
```

### Identifies the name of the list being used in this response

* In python, the list is hard coded and it is called questionDict. It is then passed in as 'table' to jinja through the render template, and in jinja the table is set to the variable allData. This is then passed into javascript retaining the same name, so the list is referred to as 'allData' in the javascript code. 

### Describes what the data contained in the list represent in your program

* The data that the list contains is in a table format, where each entry has a question, 4 answer choices, and a correct answer; a questionID is automatically assigned. 

### Explains how the selected list manages complexity in your program code by explaining why your program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, if you did not use the list.

* Without using a list, rather than using loops and updating questionNumber and simply indexing the list, each question would have to be separately hard coded resulting in n times the amount of code where n is the number of questions. Also, it is much simpler to edit the questionbank from the list to add a new question than to have to add it to the javascript and replicate all the code associated with the question, like going to the next question and checking the right answer.

## 3c. Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure. 

### The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:

1. Defines the procedureâ€™s name and return type (if necessary)
2. Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect
on the functionality of the procedure
3. Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection,
and iteration 

```javascript
function evaluation(view) {
            var correct = allData[answerindex]['correctAnswer'].toString()
            document.getElementById('block1').style.border = '3px'
            document.getElementById('result1').style.color = 'white'
            document.getElementById('result1').innerHTML = ''
            document.getElementById('block2').style.border = '3px'
            document.getElementById('result2').style.color = 'white'
            document.getElementById('result2').innerHTML = ''
            document.getElementById('block3').style.border = '3px'
            document.getElementById('result3').style.color = 'white'
            document.getElementById('result3').innerHTML = ''
            document.getElementById('block4').style.border = '3px'
            document.getElementById('result4').style.color = 'white'
            document.getElementById('result4').innerHTML = ''
            for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
                if (document.getElementById('option' + i).checked) {
                    if (correct ==  allData[answerindex]['answer' + i.toString()]) {
                        var x = allData[answerindex]['answer' + i.toString()];
                        console.log(x)
                        document.getElementById('block' + i.toString()).style.border = '3px solid limegreen'
                        document.getElementById('result' + i.toString()).style.color = 'limegreen'
                        document.getElementById('result' + i.toString()).innerHTML = 'Correct!'
                        if (view != "Yes" && view != "No") {
                            score = score + 1
                        }
                    }
                    else {
                        document.getElementById('block' + i.toString()).style.border = '3px solid red'
                        document.getElementById('result' + i.toString()).style.color = 'red'
                        document.getElementById('result' + i.toString()).innerHTML = 'Incorrect!'
                    }
                }
            }
            document.getElementById('score').innerHTML = "Score:" + score;

            if(view == "Yes") {
                document.getElementById("score").style.display = 'block';
            }
            else if(view == "No") {
                document.getElementById("score").style.display = 'none';
            }
            else {
                document.getElementById("score").style.display = 'none';
            }
        }
```

### The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program.


```html
    <button id="submit" type='button' onclick='evaluation()'>Submit</button>
```

```javascript
        function showScore() {
            var chosen = document.getElementById('scoreView').value;
            evaluation(chosen);
        }
```

### Describes in general what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program

* The procedure checks the submitted answer and displays whether it was correct or incorrect. It also implements the scoring feature based on if the answer was right or wrong. Finally, it determines whether the score is displayed or not. 

###  Explains in detailed steps how the algorithm implemented in the identified procedure works. Your explanation must be detailed enough for someone else to recreate it.

* The list which contains the questions and answers also has the correct answer for each question. At the index of the current question, which is answerindex as determined by a separate procedure, correctAnswer is then indexed for that question and converted to a string and stored in a variable to be compared with as the correct answer. The question and answer blocks are then styled. A for loop is used with 4 iterations to check each answer choice and change the surrounding styling to green and display correct if the answer is right or change it to red and display incorrect if the answer is wrong. Additionally, score is increased by 1 for a correct answer but it stays the same if the answer is incorrect. The difference in styling is done through an if statement that checks if that answer matches the variable correct previously established. The parameter 'view' is passed in by an input box and through if else statements, if it is yes then the score element DOM(Document Object Model) is shown but otherwise it is not shown. 

## 3d. Describes two calls to the procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute.

### First call: 

If the evaluation function is called with the argument "Yes" by typing that into the input box, then the segment of code will execute to display the score. 

### Second call: 

If the evaluation function is called with the argument "No" or anything else but "Yes", then the segment of code will execute to hide the score. 

### Describes what condition(s) is being tested by each call to the procedure. Condition(s) tested by the first call: 

The condition tested is if the argument is equal to the string "Yes".

### Condition(s) tested by the second call: 

The condition tested is if the argument is equal to the string "No".

### Identifies the result of each call. Result of the first call: 

The DOM(Document Object Model) of the score text will be shown; in other words, the score will be visible. 

### Result of the second call: 

The DOM of the score text will not be shown, so the score will not be visible.
