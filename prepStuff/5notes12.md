# 5.1 Github Pages Action

## 1. 

- Beneficial effect is that people can communicate more easily. Harmful effect is that people spend more time on computer talking than real life.
- Beneficial effect is that people can create apps to sell things online. Harmful effect is that fake apps can be created to scam people.
- Beneficial effect is that people can automate features in life like turning on lights or ordering food. Harmful effect is that people become lazy and cannot do basic work.

## 2.

Dopamine issues are definitely real. For example, in high school, I often get less motivated to study because it does not give me as much dopamine as playing video games. However, I have learned to control this and also have learned to enjoy learning more so that I stay motivated.

# 5.2 Github Pages Action

## 1. 

- Someone empowers themself in a digital world by using all the resources they can in a wise way. This menas buying a digital device and working with technology. This also means not doing anything illegal. Due to the digital divide, many people don't have equal access to these resources; it is empowering to not only use these resources but to also try to reduce the divide by helping others by creating programs for problems in the world like a website for an organization.

## 2. 

- Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by building a resource that aids them. At Del Norte High School, I can build a website for a club in which people don't know how to code or don't have access to the resources to build a website.

## 3. 

- Paper or red tape blocking is not digital empowerment. Such barriers exist at del norte, albeit unintentionally; for example, it is easier for one to do well in computer science class with a high end computer while someone who doesn't have a laptop will struggle. These kinds of barriers exist everywhere in the world; it is difficult to get a job in the tech industry without having been exposed to computers and have years of experience with them.


# 5.1 to 5.2 Notes

# 5.1 (Beneficial and Harmful Effects) Daily Video 1
## Learning Objective
* Explain how an effect of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful.
## Essential Knowledge
* People create computing innovations.
* The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations.
* Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance. 
* A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person.
* Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, like medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts. 
# 5.1 Daily Video 2
## Learning Objective
* Explain how a computing innovation can have an impact beyond its intended purpose.
## Essential Knowledge
* Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended:
* The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community.
* Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels.
* Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals.
* Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy or culture. 
* Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses.
* It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
* Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer. 

# 5.2 (Digital Divide)

## Learning Objective
* Describe issues that contribute to the digital divide. 
## Essential Knowledge
* Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries.
* The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet.
* The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals.
* The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally. 
* The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments.
