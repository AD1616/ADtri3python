- I forgot about the part where in the original system, there was a prerecorded message the user had to listen to which was removed in the upgraded system. This made my answer wrong. 
- The correct answer was that the upgraded system is least likely to be able to provide a human representative for any incoming call, as there are business hours as a condition.

## Question 23

- I got public key and symmetric key encryption mixed up. In public key encryption, there is a public key and a private key.
- A group of cookies stored by the user's web browser was the correct answer because it can be used to track the user and collect information.

## Question 39

- The way this works, two run at the same time. So if 60 and 30 run at the same time, after 30 seconds the second processor can run the 50 second process. 
- There is still 30 seconds left on the 60 second process, but it runs in parallel to the 50 second process so the total is just 80 seconds.
