# Study Plan

# Week 5

* I will study all the previous notes from CB and use quizlet for practice questions. 
* I will also review my mistakes from the in class practice mc's. 
* I will plan to finish my create task over this weekend as it is pretty much ready to turn in.

## Reflection

* I got 47/50 on one quiz with some dumb mistakes, and got 50/50 on the second quiz. 
* I learned a bit about parallel computing but other than that I did not make any significant errors.
* My create task is polished up and is ready to turn in with some last thoughts.

# Week 6 plan

* Turn in the create task
* Review some of the terms from topics like internet protocols. Make sure I am familiar with all CS jargon that might be asked.
