# 5.3 (Computing Bias)
## Learning Objective
* Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.
## Essential Knowledge
* Computing innovations can reflect existing human bias because of bias written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development. 
# 5.4 (Crowdsourcing)
## Learning Objective
* Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.
## Essential Knowledge
* Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
* Science has been affected by using distributed and citizen science to solve scientific problems.
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices. 
* Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet.
* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
* Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.
