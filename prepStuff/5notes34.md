# 5.3 Github Pages Action

## [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)

## Thoughts on the video

- No, the owner does not think that this was intentional; the video is a satire meant to be humorous. Despite acknowledging HP as being "racist", the video is there to make a point and illustrate a bug in a funny way.
- I think this happened through some kind of algorithmic error so that the webcam would only track faces and not things other than faces. Somehow, black faces are not detected as basis and are excluded by the algorithm.
- This is harmful because black people are a significant and important part of the population and they cannot just be excluded like this. The program definitely was not intended to be harmful, and this is an unintended bias. 
- This should certainly be corrected so black people can enjoy the same features as everyone else.
- I would train a deep learning algorithm on a data set that includes more black faces. The problem probably came from only training the algorithm on white faces. 

# 5.4 Github Pages Action

- One crowdsource idea is to have everyone give feedback about the compouter science principles class so that the teachers can improve the class by hearing everyone's point of view. This can be initiated through a simple google form or other comment system sent in slack.
- Del Norte crowdsourcing can be done by getting data from students about the difficulty of classes, their opinions on homework, their mental health, etc. My final project can be better with crowdsourcing for sure; it is actually completely based on crowdsourcing because each person inputs data about themselves into a user database.  


# 5.3 (Computing Bias)

## Learning Objective

* Explain how bias exists in computing innovations.

## Essential Knowledge

* Computing innovations can reflect existing human bias because of bias written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
* Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.
* Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development. 

# 5.4 (Crowdsourcing)

## Learning Objective

* Explain how people participate in problem-solving processes at scale.

## Essential Knowledge

* Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
* Science has been affected by using distributed and citizen science to solve scientific problems.
* Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices. 
* Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet.
* Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
* Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.
