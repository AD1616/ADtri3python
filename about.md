## Projects

- In Trimester 1, we created a website all about rice. This included information about rice, recipes, and fun activities like a scavenger hunt and a quiz.
- In Trimester 2, we created a website to be like canvas. It had different pages for different subjects as well as a dashboard to navigate. We had different information stored using SQL databases and we had cool things like a synergy API, a quiz, and a calculator. 

## Project and Technical Plan

- In Trimester 3, we will be creating a user database for Mr. Mortensen to use in his AP Computer Science classes at Del Norte. My technical expertise in SQL databases will be useful for this, and we will look into things like making backups for the database.
